# easy-python-api-flask
A simple implementation of public API on local machine using Python and Flask.

# How does it work?
main.py will use the path with images (snake_path) you'll have to choose yourself.
To access the API you should enter http://127.0.0.1:777/snake/ and you'll get a snake image link.

# How do I get a random image?
You get the image by getting the full list of images, shuffling it and then choosing the first one in the list.
